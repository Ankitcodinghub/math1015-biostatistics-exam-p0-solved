3. To determine if a new type of fertilizer is different from the type currently in use, researcher Adam took 12 two-acre plots of land scattered throughout a farm. Each plot was divided into two equal-size subplots, one of which was treated with the current fertilizer and the other of which was treated with the new fertilizer. Wheat was planted, and the crop yields were measured. He entered the data in R as below.

Answer with explanation:

Assignment Project Exam Help

1. (a) (i) 50.77

(ii) Right-skewed with two outliers.

are two outliers for AQI in the CE region.

(iv) One day.

(ii) 19.887 + 0.714 √ó 40

(iii) First answer: Median of AQI in CE will give median of AQI in NW.

Second answer:

a gives standardised value, b gives percentile and

c gives original value of AQI in NW (reverse of standardisation). So c is the answer.

Explanation: From L10, P.31, the steps are

Step 1: Find the z score in the x direction: zx.

Step 2: Find the predicted z score in the y direction: zy = r ‚àó zx. Step 3: Translate zy back to the percentile in the y direction.

That means

In step 1, we need to find the z score for the 90th percentile rank in the CE direction. The qnorm function can help us with this.

qnorm(0.9)

Using, we find this value is 1.28.

qnorm(0.9)*cor(CE,NW)

In step 2, now a is describing this which is to multiply the z-score by the correlation coefficient,.

data point ‚Äì mean

z score =

sd

Then after some rearranging, we have

data point = (z score √ó sd) + mean

which is what the R code in c is giving you.

2. (a) 32000 and 48000 respectively (total 100000√ó0.8 = 80000; Vote A: 80000√ó0.4 = 32000; Not vote A: 80000 √ó 0.6 = 48000)

(b) 0.0153949 because finite population adjustment factor should be applied when sampling is done without replacement.

(c) 10000 and 1000 respectively.

(d) The expected gain is 10[0.5 √ó 0.4 + 0.6 √ó (‚àí1)] = ‚àí4, a loss of $4.

(e) The box should contain

32000 ‚Äú1‚Äù (A ‚Äú1‚Äù, B ‚Äú0‚Äù; difference ‚Äú1 ‚àí 0‚Äù),

24000 ‚Äú‚àí1‚Äù (A ‚Äú0‚Äù, B ‚Äú1‚Äù; difference ‚Äú0 ‚àí 1‚Äù) and 24000 ‚Äú0‚Äù (A ‚Äú0‚Äù, B ‚Äú0‚Äù; difference ‚Äú0 ‚àí 0‚Äù).

3. (a) Control experiment

(b) There are pairs of yield from using current and new fertiliser applied to the same plot of land with equal area.

(c) H0 : ¬µ1 = ¬µ2 vs ¬µ1 6= ¬µ2 where ¬µ1 and ¬µ2 are the mean yield from using current and new fertilisers.

(d) The boxplot is not symmetric and the some points in QQ plot does not lie close to the QQ line. Also the Shapiro Wilk test is significant with P-value less than 0.05. All these indicate that the data do not follow a normal distribution.

(e) The test statistic is 1.8946 and P value is 0.08471 &gt; 0.05. There is not sufficient evidence in the data against H0 that the two fertilisers have the same effect on yield.

Note but not answer: Even though the test fails to find evidence against H0, we can‚Äôt claim that the two fertilisers are equal because we have already assumed H0 to be true in all calculation. Hence the failure of normality assumption is not an issue as the result is inconclusive (data consistent with H0).

In case of significant result (P value &lt; 0.05), one should remark that the result

Assignment Project Exam Helpof ‚Äúsignificant difference between fertilisers‚Äù is valid only when the normality

(g) The test statistic is -1.0481 and P value is 0.3096 &gt; 0.05. Hence the data are consistent with H0 that the two fertilisers have the same effect on yield. Just further note: Although the degrees of freedom is higher than 11, there are more variability within each sample than within the sample of differences.
